\section{Business Proposal}
\subsection{Business name origin}
\paragraph{}
I came up with the name of the business based on what the business does.
``Poly'' means many~\cite{Dictionary.com2017}, and the company
specializes in licensing consulting, so ``Polycense'' was made. The name
represent not only the field the company works in, but the slew of licenses
available for things such as: software, hardware, artwork, etc.

\subsection{What Polycense does}
\paragraph{License consulting} 
Simply put, Polycense helps individuals, businesses, artists, creators, and
more through the process of choosing and appropriate license for their 
product/work. Whether it be one of the many Creative Commons licenses
for a piece of art, or a more permissive, yet still open license for
an enterprises open-source project.
